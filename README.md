# awsNFTDapp
We are building a serverless NFT Dapp using microservices to show you how to use AWS to host your applications.

Using our template, you will be able to create a full structured environment and learn how to set this up yourself.

*WARNING - This is not intended for production use. It is intended to give you a basic understanding of how build a scalable serverless architecture for your app. We recommend you consult with a Solutions Architect and obtain a security audit to make sure there are no holes in your infrastructure before you release anything to production.*
